# Global Agricultural Yield Analysis

This project explores historical crop yields and yield gaps across various countries, providing data-driven insights for sustainable agricultural planning.

## Objectives
* Analyse trends in actual and attainable crop yields for diverse agricultural products.
* Identify "yield gaps"—the difference between potential and actual harvest—for key staple crops like barley, wheat, and rice.
* Visualise correlations between different crop yields to understand global agricultural productivity.

## Technologies
* **Python**: Core programming and data processing.
* **Pandas**: Data cleaning and complex filtering.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Statistical visualisation of yield distributions and geographic trends.
* **NumPy**: Numerical operations and missing data handling.

## Key Insights
* **Yield Potential**: Identified significant differences between actual yields and attainable benchmarks, highlighting opportunities for agricultural improvement.
* **Longitudinal Trends**: Monitored crop performance over several decades to observe the impact of changing variables on food security.
* **Data Synthesis**: Reduced a complex dataset of over 200 variables into a targeted analysis of high-impact crops.

## Usage
1. Place `crop_yields.csv` in the root directory.
2. Install requirements: `pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy`.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook to view the full Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and visualisations.
